# Solid_Work-Project
3D CAD modeling project of a Lathe Machine designed in SolidWorks. The project includes detailed part models, assembly, and technical drawings to demonstrate mechanical design and visualization skills
🛠️ Lathe Machine Project (SolidWorks)
📌 About the Project

This repository contains the 3D design and assembly of a Lathe Machine, created using SolidWorks.
The project showcases parametric modeling, part design, and assembly constraints applied to a complete machine tool.

📂 Contents

Part Models (.SLDPRT) – Individual components of the lathe machine.

Assembly File (.SLDASM) – Complete assembly with applied mates/constraints.

Technical Drawings (.SLDDRW / .PDF) – 2D engineering drawings with dimensions.

Exported Files (.STEP, .IGES) – For compatibility with other CAD software
